       paragraphs.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On here desk, 
        lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> and all the other 
        scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of 
        <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, 
        and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar 
        Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better 
        to do</q>. Although many considered her poineering work, unravelling the secrets of 
        the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had 
        something better to do.
